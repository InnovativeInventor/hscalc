## hscalc
A simple command-line calcultor utility with various styles of implementation. Monadic parsing, functors, combinators, and lambda expressions galore!

Not ready for real use yet.

TODO:

- [ ] proper parens parsing
- [ ] get monadic parser to respect order of operations
- [ ] allow for efficient factoring and checking if prime (may be useful for CTFs)
